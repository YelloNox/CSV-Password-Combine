Heeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy, my friend! Oh boy, do I have something extra special for youuuuuuuuuuuu! I got this insanely crazy script that's gonna blow your mind. Like, it's all about merging passwords from two CSV files and smushing them into one output file. And guess what? GPT is here too, doin' its magic and makin' things all cray-cray. So, here's the deal, pal. Brace yourself!

## How the F\*ck does this work? Listen Up!

Alright, listen up, my f\*ck friend! I'm only gonna say this once, so pay the f\*ck attention. We got this mega-awesome function called `combine_passwords`. It's got three things you gotta know about: `file1`, `file2`, and `output_file`. Don't worry, I won't repeat myself, so soak it in while you can. We open up `file1`, read the passwords, and dump 'em into this thing called a dictionary. Same goes for `file2`, got it? If we find a password that matches in both files, we update it in the dictionary. If not, we add a brand spankin' new one. Easy peasy!

Now, here's where the fun kicks in. We gotta find all those whacky field names that make our merged passwords special. So, we create this set called `fieldnames` and just throw all the keys from the dictionary into it. Boom! Super-duper organized, my friend!

But tighten the f\*ck up, 'cause the party ain't over yet. It's time to write our merged passwords to the output file. We open that bad boy up, work some serious CSV magic, and *poof*! All the passwords are saved, ready to rock and roll!

## How to Rock This Script Like a Drunk Rockstar

Alright, listen up, my booze bandit. To make this script work its magic, you just gotta call that crazy function, `combine_passwords`, and give it the paths to your input files. We're talkin' about `passwords1.csv` and `passwords2.csv`, got it? And don't forget to tell it where the f\*ck you want those merged passwords to gooooooo. You know, like `combined_passwords.csv`. Can't go wrong with that, right?

This script can be run in two ways, my friend. You got options, so choose your poison:

Option 1: Fire up the Python 2.x party by typing:

```bash
python harmonized_passwords.py
```

Option 2: If you're a Python 3.x kind of person, show some love with this command:

```bash
python3 harmonized_passwords.py
```

And that's it, my friend! Sit the f\*ck back, chillax, and watch the frickin' magic happen. The passwords from `file1` and `file2` will join forces, their fields all mashed up together, ready to party in the legendary `combined_passwords.csv`. Cheers to laziness and gettin' things done in style!

Oh, and don't forget! Make sure your input files are in proper CSV format and have the right f\*ckin' fields. Ain't no party without the right ingredients, am I right? Now go ahead, my tipsy amigo, and rock this script like the ultimate drunk rockstar you are! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
