In the drunkard's words:

Alright, my dude, listen up. This code right here comes with the MIT License, which 
basically means you can do whatever the f*ck you want with it. You're free to use, 
copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, or sell this software, no strings 
attached. But hey, there's a catch (ain't there always?). You gotta include the 
copyright notice and this permission notice in all copies or substantial portions of the software.

Now, let's talk about the nitty-gritty. This software is provided "as is" without any 
warranty of any kind. No guarantees, my friend. You're on your own. The authors or 
copyright holders ain't liable for any claims, damages, or liabilities that might 
come up. It's your responsibility to use this software wisely and at your own risk.

So, there you have it, my friend. The MIT License gives you the absolute freedom to do
whatever the hell you want with this badass software. It's like having a license to thrill, baby! 
But listen up, because with great power comes great responsibility. You gotta play it smart,
my compadre, and own up to your actions. Take charge, be accountable, and rock this sh*t like a boss.
Stay cool, stay epic, and enjoy the wild ride ahead! Cheers!
